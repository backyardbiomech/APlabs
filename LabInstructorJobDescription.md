# Lab Instructor Job Description

Occasionally in BIOL 206 or 207, the instructor for a lab section is different than the instructor for the lecture portion. In this case, because the courses are combined lecture/lab, the lecture instructor is the *instructor of record* for the course. Because the reason for the split load is to reduce the hours demanded of the lecture instructor, much of the weekly work is part of the lab instructor's duties, while the lecture instructor is responsible for creating the standards and course policies. 

### Lecture Instructor Duties

1. Syllabus creation
2. Semester lab schedule (in consultation with the other A&P instructors and Lab Instructor)
3. Course policies (including grading weights, but not the actual grading of lab materials)
4. Canvas shell construction
5. Mid-term and final grade submissions in Banner

### Lab Instructor Duties

The lab instructor must follow the policies determined by the lecture instructor, though the two should agree to determine the exact level of autotomy in lab instruction. The following are suggested guidelines for a job-description for the lab instructor.

The lab instructor is responsible for:

1. Inventorying and ordering supplies for lab as early in the semester (or earlier) as possible, in direct consultation with the other lab instructors.
2. Weekly set up and/or take down of labs as needed depending on the schedule of the other lab sections. The lab instructor should directly coordinate this with the other lab instructors.
3. Designing and delivering lab introductory materials (in consultation with the lecture instructor)
4. Answering student questions during lab, running the experiments, informally quizzing students to guide studying.
5. Printing materials needed for labs.
6. Proctoring any weekly lab quizzes described in the syllabus
7. Dispensing, collecting, and grading weekly lab activities or lab notebooks (as described in the syllabus).
8. Setting up, proctoring, taking down, and grading lab practical exams consistent with the teaching of the labs, but following the structure outlined by the lecture instructor and the collective A&P Labs agreements.
9. Entering grades in Canvas in the appropriate assignments as soon as possible.
10. Taking attendance (this may be in Canvas, by lab quiz or lab notebook submission, etc., in consultation with the lecture instructor)
11. Communicating concerns about students to the lecture instructor, and if necessary for Care Team level concerns, the department chair. 

### General Lab Expectations

These suggestions are general, and should be modified in disucssion between the lecture and lab instructors.

1. There may or may not be a lab quiz each week, depending on the schedule and the syllabus. This is a good way to get students to arrive on time, and to ensure they are prepared for the lab. If there is a quiz, it should be given at the beginning of the lab period, and should be graded and returned before the end of the lab period.
2. The lab instructor should introduce the lab material with a brief lecture presentation. This should not be longer than 15-20 minutes to allow students to have time to complete the lab activities. The lecture should include a brief overview of the lab material, the objectives of the lab, and any safety concerns.
3. Students should have as much freedom as possible to explore the lab material, but the lab instructor should be available to answer questions and guide students as needed.
