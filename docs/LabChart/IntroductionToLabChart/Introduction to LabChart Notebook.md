## Introduction to LabChart Notebook

1. What happened when you opened your saved data file?
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

2. Today you used a `Finger Pulse Transducer` to collect some physiological data and make some recordings.  In your own words, being as specific as you can, describe what is actually being recorded by the PowerLab and displayed in LabChart. 
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;
1. Why is it important to have the Finger Pulse Transducer attached properly?  What happens if it is too tight or too loose when on the volunteerâ€™s finger?
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;
2. Name two physiological variables, other than finger pulse, that you could measure with the PowerLab system.
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;
3. What was the volunteer's heart rate based on the single peak-to-peak measurement?
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;
4. What was the calculated heart rate based on the cyclic measurements as shown in the Data Pad?
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;
5. If the two heart rates were different, why do you think that is?
