# Lab 2: The Heart - Physiology

## Preparation for lab

To get the most out of this lab you need to be prepared. The basic knowledge needed for this lab is covered in Amerman "Human Anatomy and Physiology" in Chapter 17.3 "Cardiac Muscle Tissue Anatomy and Electrophysiology".

In addition to reading, you should review this [basic video on EKG physiology from your book's publisher](https://mediaplayer.pearsoncmg.com/assets/V1kYPD_O_9iP5HtiqJnI_fPWbzLFOsbT).

## Introduction

Electrocardiography (ECG or EKG) records the summated electrical activity of the heart muscle and enables us to diagnose may heart diseases, i.e. arrhythmia (irregular heartbeats), infarction (blocked coronary blood vessels), hyperkalemia (elevated levels of potassium), and many more. Plotting the electrical activity over time results in a characteristic waveform consisting of a P-wave, QRS-complex and T-wave. Variations in this pattern indicate pathological condition. For example, the lack of a P-wave indicates a problem with the heart’s SA-node pace maker.

### How the EKG works and what the PowerLab Data Acquisition Unit does

Modern electrocardiographs are complex machines that contain a computer and algorithms to automatically analyze the collected data. But even those machines are essentially just electronic amplifiers that measure the tiny electric fields generated by the electric charges moving across the heart muscle. These amplified signals are filtered and then displayed either on a screen or with a plotter on paper.

The PowerLab system contains the necessary amplifier and filter as well as a A/D (analog-to-digital) converter which translates the voltage fluctuations in a digital signal (a series of numbers) that the computer can plot.

### Navigating LabChart

LabChart is the software that allows you to control the PowerLab unit and display the acquired data. To effectively use the LabChart system you’ll need to learn how to use the software.

## Recording an ECG

### Electrodes and Leads

The simplest form of ECG uses 4 electrodes (one each at wrists and ankles) to measure the electric field across the heart from 3 different directions or ’leads’. These 3 directions are called the *limb leads* and they are traditionally labeled I, II, and III (see figure).

The 12 leads and directions from which an ECG meassures the electrical activity of the heart. Lead I, II, and III are the limb leads and are present in the simplest ECG. The augmented limb leads aVF, aVL, and aVR are calculated. A 12-lead ECG additionally records the red vectors. (Source: Wikipedia)

From these three leads, 3 additional leads can be calculated: the three *augmented limb leads* traditionally labeled aVR, aVL, and aVF (augmented right, left, and foot). But even looking at the heart from 6 angles might not be enough to diagnose a specific problem. A cardiologist might add up to 6 additional electrodes (traditionally labeled V₁ through V₆) to bring the total to 10 electrodes and 12 different perspectives, an arrangement that is called the 12-lead EKG.

Which electrode goes where? While most modern ECG machines will tell you if an electrode is placed incorrectly, the 4 basic leads have a standardized colors and their placement is easy to remember: clouds (white right arm) over grass (green right leg), white on the right, and smoke (black left arm) over fire (red left leg).


DIRECTIONS: For this part lab we’ll follow the LabChart Human Physiology lesson *"ECG and Heart Sounds"* and fill out the provided data report sheet.

### Tips for getting a good ECG

A good ECG looks something like the graph below. Notice that the baseline is mostly level, and there are regularly spaced peaks arising from that baseline. Notice the P-waves, the QRS complex, and the T-waves. Notice that other than those waves, line is generally smooth. This is what the ECG should look like in the calibration step.

Example of a good ECG trace recorded in lab.

A "bad" ECG lacks those things. The three most common errors are inverted or different waves and complexes; a shifting baseline (looks like the peaks are on a rising or falling slope); or high frequency noise (lots of small waves covering these bigger waves of interest). The three most common causes of a "bad" ECG are *improper connections of wires* (wrong color to the wrong electrode on the body), *subject movement* (remember: muscle create electrical fields, too!), and *poor contact between the electrodes and the skin* (usually caused by the wires pulling at the electrodes or dried-in electrodes). Use kinesiology-tape if you can’t the electrodes to stick! At each step where you are asked to confirm the quality of your ECG following recording, if it is "bad", check those three things.
