# Lab 1: The Heart - Anatomy

Name:___________________

1. Chambers and Valves: Describe the four chambers of the heart. How do the atrioventricular
   and semilunar valves function differently in regulating blood flow within the heart?
2. Blood Flow Pathway: Trace the pathway of blood through the heart, starting from the vena
   cava and ending at the aorta. Include the roles of each chamber and valve in your
   description.
3. Cardiac Muscle Tissue: Compare and contrast the structure of cardiac muscle tissue with
   that of skeletal muscle. How does the unique structure of cardiac muscle support its
   function?
4. Coronary Circulation: Identify the major coronary arteries and veins on the dissected heart.
   Explain their significance in providing oxygen and nutrients to the heart muscle.
5. Electrical Conduction System: Locate and describe the components of the heart's electrical
   conduction system (sinoatrial node, atrioventricular node, bundle of His, and Purkinje fibers).
   How does this system coordinate the heartbeat?
