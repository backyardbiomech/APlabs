# Lab 5: Diffusion and Osmosis

1. What do you expect will happen to the dialysis bags?

   | Bag # | What do you think will happen in the osmosis experiment? |
   | ----- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
   | 1     |                                                          |
   | 2     |                                                          |
   | 3     |                                                          |

2. Why do the instructions suggest to test the water you use for the Diffusion in the tube for
   Chlorine? Did you find any?

3. What is the chemical reaction behind the Silver Nitrate test, or in other words, what is the
   white cloud that forms in the presence of Chloride ions?

4. Are you familiar with the Iodine and Benedict Test? What do they detect? How do you
   interpret the colors?

   | Test                 |                                 | After adding                 | Expected <br />Color |
   | -------------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------- |
   | Silver <br />Nitrate | Chloride ions NOT present       | AgNO³                        |                      |
   | Silver <br />Nitrate | Chloride ions present           | AgNO³                        |                      |
   | Iodine               | Starch NOT present              | Iodine                       |                      |
   | Iodine               | Starch  present                 | Iodine                       |                      |
   | Benedict             | Reducing Sugars NOT<br/>present | Benedict Solution +<br/>heat |                      |
   | Benedict             | Reducing Sugars<br/>present     | Benedict Solution +<br/>heat |                      |

   

5. What are the results of the Filtration experiment?

      |                             | filtrate color | explaination |
      | --------------------------- | -------------- | ------------ |
      | Methylene Blue              |                |              |
      | Methylene Blue and Charcoal |                |              |

      HOW is activated charcoal removing the Methylene Blue? (It’s not a chemical reaction.)

6. Coming back to the Osmosis experiment:
