# Lab 8: Organ Systems (fetal pig dissection)

Name: __________

1. Comparative Anatomy: How does the anatomy of a fetal pig compare to human anatomy in
   terms of organ placement and structure? Provide specific examples of similarities and
   differences.
2. Respiratory System: Describe the structure of the fetal pig's lungs. How are they adapted for
   gas exchange? Also, discuss the developmental differences you might observe in the
   respiratory system of a fetal pig compared to that of a mature pig.
3. Digestive System: Trace the path of food through the digestive system of the fetal pig,
   starting from the mouth and ending at the rectum. Include a description of the major organs
   involved and their specific functions.
4. Circulatory System: Explain the functioning of the fetal pig's heart, including the role of the
   foramen ovale and ductus arteriosus in fetal circulation. How does this differ from the
   circulatory system of a mature pig?
5. Urogenital System: Describe the urogenital system of the fetal pig. How can you
   differentiate between a male and female fetal pig based on their internal and external
   anatomical features?
