3. Why does a positive Benedict’s test first turn green and then orange?

4. You added starch to EACH test tube. Which test tubes tested negative for the presence of
   starch after incubation? Why?

5. Which test tubes still contained starch? Why?

6. In the test tubes that were negative for starch, what product was formed?

7. Which tube acted as a control?

8. Why was it important to incubate the samples at 37°C?
