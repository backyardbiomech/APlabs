Name: __________

1. Record results of the URS-10 test strip and compare to the expected results:

   | test             | expected result | your result |
   | ---------------- | --------------- | ----------- |
   | volume           | 40 ml/hr        |             |
   | transparency     | transparent     |             |
   | pH               | 4.5 - 8         |             |
   | specific gravity | 1.001 - 1.030   |             |
   | leucocytes       | negative        |             |
   | nitrite          | negative        |             |
   | urobilinogen     | negative        |             |
   | protein          | negative        |             |
   | blood            | negative        |             |
   | ketone           | negative        |             |
   | bilirubin        | negative        |             |
   | glucose          | negative        |             |

2. When our body burns fat instead of glucose it produces substances called ketones. The
ketones end up in your blood and urine. Under what conditions might this happen?
3. When would you expect blood, proteins, or leukocytes in your urine?
4. Make a sketch of the dissected kidney that will help you to explain how the kidney works.
5. Where does "dirty" blood enter the kidney?
6. Where does "clean" blood leave the kidney?
7. What is urine and where does it leave the kidney?
8. What happens in the renal cortex?
9. The medulla is the region located inward from the cortex. What happens here?
