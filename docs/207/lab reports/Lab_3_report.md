1. The largest artery in the human body, which carries oxygenated blood away from the heart to the rest of the body, is the ____________________.
   
2. The vein that returns deoxygenated blood from the lower part of the body to the heart is called the ____________________.
   
3. The blood vessels responsible for the exchange of oxygen, nutrients, and waste products at the cellular level are called ____________________.

Below or on the back of this paper, draw a "subway map" of the blood vessels you are responsible for knowing. Take a look at the [DC Metro map](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:WMATA_system_map.svg) if you don't know what one looks like. Don't worry about making it anatomically accurate other than the branches and intersections. Start with the four chambers of the heart as the central station. Get general directions down. Use colors. Label the branches. Label the target organs or regions of the body. Get creative. **Be able to draw this from memory**.
