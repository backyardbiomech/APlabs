## Lab 2: The Heart - Physiology

Name: __________

1.) Draw the basic shape of one ECG cycle and label P wave, QRS complex, T wave, and ST-segment











2.) Which of the following happens during which part of the cycle? (add the numbers to your graph)

> 1) Atrial depolarization
> 2) Ventricular depolarization
> 3) Ventricular repolarization
> 4) Time between ventricular depolarization and repolarization



3.) If an ECG shows an irregular rhythm with no distinct P waves and rapid QRS complexes, what is the likely diagnosis?

4.) Draw a simple diagram of the electrical conduction system of the heart, labeling the SA node, AV node, bundle of His, bundle branches, and Purkinje fibers. Indicate where each part corresponds to the ECG waveform.











5.) What would expect to be the difference in an ECG taken from a person at rest, and one taken from a person who just ran up 3 flights of stairs?
