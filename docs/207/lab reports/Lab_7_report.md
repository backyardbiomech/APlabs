1. How much air does a person approximately expire per hour? per day? per week? per year?
2. Absorption and excretion of gases:
   You are locked in an airtight room that is 8 ft by 8 ft by 8 ft, i.e. has a volume of about 14â€™
   liter. Wow much oxygen is it this room?
3. How long would it take you to consume all the oxygen in the room?
4. Given an average life expectancy of 78 years , how many tons of carbon dioxide do you
   exhale over your life time?
