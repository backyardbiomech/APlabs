1. Measuring Respiratory Volumes

   | Subject | TV   | IRV  | ERV  | VC   | TV+IRV+ERV |
   | ------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---------- |

2. Estimating Vital Capacity

   | Subject | VC estimate method 1 | VC estimate method 2 | VC measured |

3. Why do the values of VC from the different methods not match precisely?

4. Lung Ventilation

   | Subject | Breathing Rate<br />[breath / min] | TV<br />[L / breath] | RMV<br />[L / min] | PV<br />[L / min] |

   |         |                                    |                      |                    |                   |
   |         |                                    |                      |                    |                   |
   |         |                                    |                      |                    |                   |

1. How much air does a person approximately expire per hour? per day? per week? per year?  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
2. Absorption and excretion of gases: You are locked in an airtight room that is 8 ft by 8 ft by 8 ft, i.e. has a volume of about 14,500 liters.

+ How many **liters** of oxygen are in the room?  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
+ Severe symptoms of low oxygen begin when air has about 10.5% oxygen (it's actually higher than that, but we'll simplify for this). How long would it take you to consume enough oxygen to bring the room air down to that 10.5%? Assume that with each normal breath your blood absorbs 25 mL of oxygen. 
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;

7. Per breath you also **produce** about 25mL of CO~2~. Given an average life expectancy of 78 years, how many **tons** of carbon dioxide do you exhale over your life time?
