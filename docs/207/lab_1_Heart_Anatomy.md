# Lab 1: The Heart - Anatomy

## Preparation for lab

To get the most out of this lab you need to be prepared. The basic knowledge needed for this lab is covered in "OpenStax Anatomy and Physiology" in Chapter 19.1 "The Cardiovascular System: Heart Anatomy".

## Introduction

The heart has a complex three dimensional structure that is very difficult to learn from a textbook or screen. It is far easier understood while dissecting it. We will be using pig hearts (or if not available, sheep hearts) that have been preserved in a fixative to prevent decay and make it easier to separate tissues. While this fixative does not contain formaldehyde, it is still advised to wear gloves and safety glasses - after all fixatives fix tissues including yours if you are note careful. Take your time dissecting! This lab is designed to leave you time to explore and not to rush you through the material. Compare what you see with your textbook and/or lecture notes. What are all these structures and how might they work? For many this will be the only opportunity in their life to actually see what the text books are trying to describe.

## Surface

If the pericardial sac is still intact, use a scalpel to detach the **parietal pericardium**. Carefully pull a little of the **serous membrane** from the myocardium and observe. Is there any **adipose tissue** (fat) visible on the heart surface? If yes, carefully scrape away while paying attention to the **coronary blood vessels** which supply the heart muscle with nutirtents and oxygen. There should be left and right coronary artery and the cardiac veins. What happens if one of them gets blocked by a blood clot?

Identify the **base** and **apex** of the heart. Identify the **auricles** - wrinkled pouch-like flaps protruding from the **atrial chambers** that increase their capacity. Next, identify the pulmonary trunk and the aorta. If the aorta has not been cut too close to the heart, you might see the **aortic arch** with the brachiocephalic, left carotid, and left subclavian arteries branching off.

## Atria

Cut through the aorta until you see **aortic semilunar valve**. Right above it you should be able to find the two openings to the **coronary arteries**; probe them! Turn the heart so that you look at its posterior surface (compare to a figure in a textbook if you are not sure what this should look like). There are four **pulmonary veins** entering the left atrium (on your left!) and the **inferior and superior venae cavae** entering the right atrium, but depending on where they were cut they might be very short. Where do they come from and what do they transport? Insert a probe in the superior vena cava and through the atrium on into the inferior vena cava. Using scissors, cut parallel to the probe to open up the atrium. Study the **tricuspid valve** and count the number of valve flaps. Is it the number you expected?

Identify the pulmonary trunk and cut through its anterior wall until you can see the **pulmonary semilunar valve**.

Continue the cut through the pulmonary trunk into the right ventricle. Then cut down, around, and up through the tricuspid valve to make the cut continuous with the cut you made across the right atrium. You should be able to spread the right atrium open to see a small opening just below the opening of the inferior vena cava: this is the coronary sinus which returns the venous coronary blood. Nearby in the interatrial septum is a depression. The is the remnant of the **foramen ovale**, an opening that passed blood from the right to the left atrium in the fetal heart.

## Ventricles

Now examine the opened **ventricular chamber**. Observe the fibrous **chordae tendineae** that attach e.g. on the ventricular side of the tricuspid valve. What do you think their function is? Try to move the valve flaps - how far can you move them in which direction?

Make a longitudinal incision through the left atrium and ventricle. Compare the thickness of the left and right ventricular **myocardium**. Why is the wall of the left ventricle so much thicker? Dissect down to the **mitral valve** and count the number of valve flaps. Do pig/sheep heart valves have the same "design" as the human valves shown in the text book? What are other differences?

Now that most of the heart is accessible, trace the blood flow through the heart starting at the vena cava. The heart is typically described as two side-by-side pumps. What are those pumps? Why do you have two pumps on not just one? Why do you need valves? When is the blood in the **systemic** and when in the **pulmunary circuit**?

## Cleanup

This concludes the ’guided tour’ through the heart, but please feel free to keep exploring to your heart’s content... For cleanup, please place the organic tissue in the provided black plastic bag (they need to be double bagged before they go in the trash!). Rinse the dissection tools and the dish in the sink and place them next to the sink on some paper towel for drying.
