# Lab 8: Diffusion and Osmosis

## Preparation for lab

To get the most out of this lab you need to be prepared. The basic knowledge needed for this lab is covered in "OpenStax Anatomy and Physiology" in Chapter 3.1 "The Cell Membrane".

## Introduction

Diffusion and osmosis are two processes that are essential for life to function. These processes are behind the movement of small particles, i.e. the molecules in your body, and understanding osmosis and diffusion allows you to predict in which direction and with which speed these particles will travel. Diffusion e.g. explains how oxygen gets to your cells so they can breathe and their mitochondria can make ATP. Osmosis explains why cells would ’explode’ if you were to accidentally grab a bag of distilled water instead a of a bag of saline for a transfusion. These processes are also absolute essential to understand e.g. how the kidney works.

Diffusion is slow... which makes this lab more challenging. Prepare all the dialysis tubing bags in the beginning of the lab as **it will take about 45 minutes before you re-measure the volumes and record the results**. Use this 45 break to form a hypothesis about what you will observe, understand the Silver Nitrate, Iodine, and Benedict tests and why you use them here, and do the Filtration exercise. Then go back and measure the dialysis tubing bags!

## Osmosis

Osmosis is the diffusion of water. Water moves down its own concentration gradient, moving from areas of low solute concentration (= high water concentration) to areas of high solute concentration (= low water concentration).

DIRECTIONS:

Prepare three dialysis tubing bags as follows:

Bag 1: Measure 15 mL of GLYCEROL into a dialysis tubing bag. Rinse the bag with distilled water to remove excess glycerol and then suspend it in a beaker of 200 mL of DISTILLED WATER.

Bag 2: Measure 15 mL of DISTILLED WATER into a dialysis tubing bag. Suspend the bag in a beaker of 200mL of GLYCEROL. (**Save this glycerol when finished - do not throw it away**)

Bag 3: Measure 15 mL of DISTILLED WATER into a dialysis tubing bag. Suspend the bag in a beaker containing 200 mL of DISTILLED WATER.

**Let all preparations sit for min. 45 minutes - diffusion takes time!**  

Continue with the other experiments and come back to record the results later. 
Carefully measure the volume of each bag and record and explain your results in the table below.  

| Bag # | Start Volume | End Volume | Change | Explanation |
| ----- | ------------ | ---------- | ------ | ----------- |
| 1     |              |            |        |             |
| 2     |              |            |        |             |
| 3     |              |            |        |             |

## Diffusion 

Simple diffusion is the movement of particles from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration. In this case, we will be examining the movement of electrolytes, i.e. ions that have disassociated in water, and their ability to move along a concentration gradient and through a semi-permeable membrane.

### Silver Nitrate Test

In this experiment we are studying the movement of Chloride ions (Cl⁻). In this experiment we are studying the movement of Chloride ions (Cl⁻). chloride ions, we use Silver Nitrate (AgNO³) by simply adding a small drop of it to the solution being tested. If no Chloride ions are present, nothing will happen. If, however, Chloride ions are present, a white cloud will form.

DIRECTIONS:

1. Pour 15ml WATER into a test tube. Test water for CHLORINE using a few drops of AgNO3. Presence of chlorine will result in a cloudy appearance.

2. Measure 15 mL of NaCl (found on front bench) into a dialysis tubing bag. Rinse the bag and then suspend it in a beaker of 200 mL of DISTILLED WATER.

3. **Let the preparation sit for min. 45 minutes - diffusion takes time!**  

   Continue with the other experiments and come back to record the results later. 
   Carefully measure the volume of each bag and record and explain your results in the table below.  

| Chlorine @ 0 min | Chlorine @ 45 min | explanation |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ----------- |
|                  |                   |             |



### Food for though

Why do the instructions suggest to test the water in the tube for Chlorine? What is the chemical reaction behind the Silver Nitrate test, or in other words, what is the white cloud that forms in the presence of Chloride ions?

## Dialysis (a clinical application of diffusion)

The kidneys have important roles in maintaining health. When healthy, the kidneys maintain the body’s internal equilibrium of water and minerals (sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, sulfate). Those acidic metabolism end-products that the body cannot get rid of via respiration are also excreted through the kidneys. Dialysis is a process for removing waste and excess water from the blood, and is used primarily to provide an artificial replacement for lost kidney function in people with renal failure. Dialysis treatments replace some of the kidneys? functions through diffusion (waste removal) and ultrafiltration (fluid removal).

A semipermeable membrane is a thin layer of material that contains holes of various sizes, or pores. Smaller solutes and fluid pass through the membrane, but the membrane blocks the passage of larger substances (for example, red blood cells, large proteins). This replicates the filtering process that takes place in the kidneys, when the blood enters the kidneys and the larger substances are separated from the smaller ones in the glomerulus.

In this portion of the lab, we will observe the passage of **small molecules rather than large molecules through a semipermeable membrane, using starch and glucose as examples**. To analyze for the presents of starch we will use the Iodine test and for the presence of glucose the Benedict’s test:

###  Review of the Iodine (Starch) test

1. Put about 3mL (approx. 15drops) of deionized water and 1 dropper-full of Iodine reagent (I₂KI) into one test tube
2. Put about 3mL (approx. 15drops) of Starch/Glucose solution and 1 dropper-full of Iodine reagent (I₂KI) into a second test tube
3. A dark blue/black or green color indicates the presence of starch.

### Review of the Benedict’s (Glucose) test

1. Put 3mL (approx. 15drops) of deionized water and 3mL of Benedicts into one test tube
2. Put 3mL (approx. 15drops) of Starch/Glucose solution and 3mL of Benedict’s into a second test tube
3. Place both tubes in boiling water bath, using test tube holder, and let heat for approx. 5 minutes
4. After approx. 5 minutes, carefully remove tubes from water bath and place in test tube rack to cool.
5. If monosaccharides and/or disaccharides are present in the sample, a colored precipitate (solid material) will have formed. If the sample remains unchanged, the test is negative.



DIRECTIONS:

1. Fill a dialysis bag with 10-15mL starch-glucose solution. Suspend the bag in a beaker of distilled water.

2. Test a sample of the distilled water and starch-glucose solution for both glucose (Benedict’s test) and starch (Iodine test).

3. **Let the preparation sit for min. 45 minutes - diffusion takes time!**  

   Continue with the other experiments and come back to record the results later. 

4. Test the contents of the beaker for both starch (Iodine) and glucose (Benedict’s).

5. Test the contents of the bag for both starch (Iodine) and glucose (Benedict’s).

6. Record results below

|                    | t = 0 min | t = 45 min | explanation |
| ------------------ | --------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| Starch in bag?     |           |            |             |
| Starch in beaker?  |           |            |             |
| Glucose in bag?    |           |            |             |
| Glucose in beaker? |           |            |             |



## Filtration

Several organs of the body, including the liver, lymph nodes, and kidneys are responsible for removing waste products from our blood and lymph via a process called filtration. Blood, lymph and waste products enter an organ and (mostly) clean blood and lymph exits. In this exercise, we will replicate that filtration process on a VERY simplistic level using water as our blood/lymph and Methylene Blue as our waste product. Charcoal will represent specific cells or proteins that our organs use to bind waste products and the filter paper is another representation of a semi-permeable membrane.


DIRECTIONS:

1. Take two test tubes and place 5 mL of distilled water into each.
2. Add 1 dropper-full of methylene blue to BOTH tubes and mix.
3. Add a pinch of activated charcoal to ONE tube and shake thoroughly.
4. Wait two minutes.
5. Pour each tube through a funnel lined with filter paper and collect the filtrate into clean test tubes. Describe the color of the filtrate in each tube and explain your results.

|                             | filtrate color | explanation |
| --------------------------- | -------------- | ----------- |
| Methylene Blue              |                |             |
| Methylene Blue and Charcoal |                |             |

The same principle is used to e.g. clean-up drinking water. Ever wondered what the little black specks are that you see when you insert a new Britta or PUR filter cartridge?

### Food for thought

HOW is activated charcoal removing the Methylene Blue? (It’s not a chemical reaction.)
