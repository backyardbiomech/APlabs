# Lab 8: Metabolism - Caloric Budget

## Preparation for lab

To get the most out of this lab you need to be prepared. The basic knowledge needed for this lab is covered in "OpenStax Anatomy and Physiology" in Chapter 24.6 "Energy and Heat Balance" and 24.7 "Nutrition and Diet".

## Introduction

**This is a take-home lab, as you will each record your energy intake (all you eat and drink), as well as your energy expenditure (all of your activity), over a 24 hour period to etablish a caloric budget. Read the compete instructions now and don't wait until the last day to record the data!** 

**Metabolism** refers to the sum total of the chemical changes which occur in the body.  Energy can be measured in many ways.  The usual physiological unit of energy metabolism is the calorie.  A **calorie** is the amount of energy required to heat 1 mL of water by one degree Celsius.  This is a very small amount of energy, so physiologists measure energy in Calories (“big-C” calories).  A Calorie is one kilocalorie (1,000 “little-c” calories).  All caloric measurements in this class will be measured in Calories, and you’ll find that this is true of all reports on the energy content of food or energy burning of exercise.  The more energy your body can get from a food, the more Calories that food has.  The more exhausting some exercise is, the more Calories have been used.  

## Estimating the Basal Metabolic Rate (MBR) ##

Basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the minimum expenditure of energy necessary to live.  It is expressed in terms of Calories burned per hour per body surface area (Cal / hr·m2). 

Calories per hour **is** metabolic rate.  However, depending on the shape and composition of your body, you may lose heat quickly or slowly.  Since humans maintain a stable internal body temperature, if you lose heat quickly you must generate more heat to stay alive, and this must be factored into any measurement of BMR.  

For example:  a tall, skinny person will lose heat much faster than a short, round person who weighs the same.  The tall, skinny person must burn more Calories per hour just to survive.  The amount of heat a person must generate in order to live – and therefore the amount of energy they must create – will not be the same from person to person.  

For this reason, BMR is measured as the Calories per hour you must generate per square meter of body surface (Cal / hr·m<sup>2</sup>). By standardizing metabolic rate to a given surface area (one m<sup>2</sup>), we can compare the metabolic rates of people of different body shapes, sizes, and compositions.  

The criteria for measuring BMR include 12 hours of fasting, 8 hours of sleep, minimal activity, and complete rest in the supine position.  Clearly, measuring BMR is very involved.  Because of this, physiologists often approximate BMR by measuring a person’s rate of Oxygen absorption.  This is known as **indirect calorimetry**. Oxygen consumption can be used to approximate BMR because it is known that the body uses one liter of Oxygen to generate about 4.825 Calories.  In the following exercise, you’ll use measurements of Oxygen absorption to estimate BMR.

A subject breathes normally into a O<sub>2</sub> spirometer for 3 minutes with their nose closed off. The instruments has an oxygen sensor and records the amount of oxygen passing the sensor over time (see graph).  Note: the *trace is drifting upwards* during the 3 minute record! This means not all oxygen that enters the lungs also leaves the lungs - a part of the oxygen is absorbed by the body. 

DIRECTIONS

1. Pick either subject 1 or 2 and measure the **absorbed** amount of O<sub>2</sub>, the amount by which the curve drifts upwards within the shown 3 minutes.  

​	ending volume O<sub>2</sub> – initial volume O<sub>2</sub> =  _________ liters O<sub>2</sub> absorbed during 3 minute trial

2. Divide the volume of O<sub>2</sub> absorbed by the number of minutes of the trial (3) to get the volume of O<sub>2</sub> absorbed per minute.   

​	_________ liters O<sub>2</sub> absorbed per minute

3. Multiply by 60 minutes per hour to get the amount of O<sub>2</sub> absorbed per hour   

​	_________ liters O<sub>2</sub> absorbed per hour

4. Because the amount of O<sub>2</sub> in the air varies depending on temperature and pressure, correct the volume of O<sub>2</sub> absorbed per hour to standard temperature and pressure (STP) by multiplying by a correction factor.  Given room temperature and our altitude, use a correction factor of 0.9.

​	_________ liters O<sub>2</sub> per hour at STP

5. Multiply this number by 4.825 to convert liters of absorbed O<sub>2</sub> per hour to Calories burned per hour.

​	_________ Calories burned per hour

6. Using the subject’s height and weight, determine the subject’s body surface area using the nomogram below. To use a nomogram, find the height on the left scale and the weight on the right scale. Draw a line between those two points and read of the surface area on the middle scale.

​	body surface area  =  _________ m<sup>2</sup>

7. Determine BMR by dividing Calories burned per hour by body surface area.

​	BMR =  _________ Calories / hr·m<sup>2</sup>

The BMR you just calculated from the provided measurements is a good estimate of this subjects BRM. There are, however,  faster ways to get to an estimate, e.g. a table like this:

| Age Range | Female | Male  |
| --------- | ------ | ----- |
| 18-19     | 38.85  | 43.32 |
| 20-21     | 38.30  | 41.43 |
| 22-23     | 37.60  | 40.82 |
| 24-27     | 36.74  | 40.24 |

How does your (complicated, measurement-based) estimate compare to the estimate provided by the table?

Why is the BR of males higher than that of females? 

Why is the BR of younger people higher than that of older people? 



## Caloric Budget: Intake and Expenditure

Over a period of 24 hours, record every food you eat (Caloric intake) and journal what you do with 15 minute precision (Caloric expenditure) - this includes *all* activities, incl. e.g. sleeping. You can use the Caloric Worksheet provided on CANVAS to record your data, or simply use a blank sheet of paper or your phone.

Once you have the data, we need to convert it.

DIRECTIONS

1. Look up with how many calories the food you ate provided your body with. You can either look at the nutrition facts label, or use a website (e.g. Google will tell you!)

   Example: you recorded eating one banana at 9am, so write down 105 calories intake

2. The energy needed to perform a physical activity is often expressed in metabolic equivalents (METs).  METs correlate your rate of energy expenditure to your resting metabolic rate.  By definition, 1 MET is the energy expended per kilogram of body weight per hour when sitting quietly.  Sleep has a MET value of 0.9 Calories per kilogram per hour.  Heavy exercise may have a MET value in the teens.  
   Convert the activities you recorded into MET, using the "Compendium of Physical Activities" posted on CANVAS, or a website (e.g. https://golf.procon.org/met-values-for-800-activities/). 
   Multiply how long you did the activity (in hours) with the MET factor you looked up and then with your bodyweight in Kg. This tells you how many calories you expended on that activity.

   Example: you recorded studying from 8am until noon (4 hours), so write down 4 hrs x 1.3 * 64 Kg = 332.8 cal expediture

3. Add up all the the intakes and, separately, all the expenditures you recorded over the 24 hour period.

4. Substract the intake from the expenditure - based just on your caloric intake and expenditure, were you losing or gaining over the 24 hour period?  

5. Let's assume person takes in 2000 calories per day, but expands 2300. Knowing that **one pound of body fat equals 3500 Calories** and assuming that every day is the same, how many days would it take for this person to lose 5 pounds? (The realty is more complex, but let's just keep it simple for this example...)

6. Assume this person's caloric intake and expenditure are perfectly equal, but she decides begin going to Starbucks every day and buying a grande-peppermint-white-chocolate-mocha-no foam-with sprinkles and drink the whole thing.  To cut back on Calories, you have it made with nonfat milk and without whipped cream.  According to Starbucks’ website, this drink contains 430 Calories.  How many days will it take to gain 5 pounds?
