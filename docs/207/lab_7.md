# Lab 7: Carbohydrate Biochemistry

## Preparation for lab

To get the most out of this lab you need to be prepared. The basic knowledge needed for this lab is covered in "OpenStax Anatomy and Physiology" in Chapter 2.5 "Organic Compounds Essential to Human Functioning".

## Introduction

Today, you will be studying how carbohydrates are digested by the human body. Like most chemical reactions in your body, carbohydrate digestion is catalyzed by enzymes. Amylase is an enzyme that breaks down starch. Amylase is produced by both your salivary glands (salivary amylase) and your pancreas (pancreatic amylase). *READ* and follow the instructions below *CAREFULLY*.

## Sample collection and preparation 

*Each member* of your lab group must collect a sample of saliva by carefully transferring saliva from mouth to a test tube. Collect at least one inch of saliva (not including any bubbles). This is your source of salivary amylase. 
The member of your group who has the least amount of saliva should boil his/her saliva over an open flame. ***CAREFUL: saliva bubbles VERY quickly when boiled.*** **Always wear eye protection and have the opening of the test tube pointing towards the wall**. Immediately remove from flame when it starts bubbling!  


DIRECTIONS: Obtain five test tubes and label them 1 - 5. Add the following to each test tube:

- Tube 1: 3 mL starch + 1 mL of saliva (contains salivary amylase!) + 1 mL distilled water

- Tube 2: 3 mL starch + 1 mL of saliva + 1 mL 5% HCl

- Tube 3: 3 mL starch + 1 mL of boiled saliva + 1 mL distilled water

- Tube 4: 3 mL starch + 1 mL of pancreatic amylase + 1 mL of distilled water

- Tube 5: 3 mL starch + 2 mL of distilled water

**Place the tubes in a warm water bath (37&deg;C)** **for about 20 minutes to allow time for digestion**. Vortex the test tubes every five minutes. 

Use this time to refresh how you analytically detect carbohydrates and form a hypothesis about which of the tubes will test positive for starch and which will test positive for monosaccharides.

## Identifying Carbohydrates: The Iodine Test for Starch

There are several simple diagnostic tests which allow the identification of different carbohydrates, the **Iodine Test** is used to identify carbohydrates in the form of starches. **When Iodine (yellow/orange in color) is added to a starch solution, a blue/black starch-Iodide complex is produced.**  

DIRECTIONS: 
After  the samples have been in the water bath for 20 minutes: Obtain a porcelain spotplate. Label five wells, one for each tube. To each spotplate well add about 4 drops from the test tube and one drop of iodine solution. Observe the colors. Which test tubes contained starch and why? Record your observations in the table.

| Test Tube # | Color | Is starch present? |
| ----------- | ----- | ------------------ |
| 1           |       |                    |
| 2           |       |                    |
| 3           |       |                    |
| 4           |       |                    |
| 5           |       |                    |



## Identifying Carbohydrates: Benedict’s Test for Monosaccharides and Reducing Disaccharides

Under suitable conditions chemicals with free aldehyde or ketone groups will transfer electrons to cupric ions (+2) to form cuprous ions (+1). Since all monosaccharides and most disaccharides can do this, they are called *reducing sugars* and their presence can be tested for by using various Copper solutions.

DIRECTIONS: 
After you tested for starch: Disregard all but  1mL of the solution from the test tube. Now, add  3 mL of reagent (Benedict’s) to each test tube. Mix well. Place the test tube into a boiling water bath for 3 minutes. Remove and let cool. The formation of a green or orange colored precipitate indicates a positive test. Note your observations in the table.

| Test Tube # | Color | Is starch present? |
| ----------- | ----- | ------------------ |
| 1           |       |                    |
| 2           |       |                    |
| 3           |       |                    |
| 4           |       |                    |
| 5           |       |                    |

## Food for thought:

- Why does a positive Benedict’s test first turn green and then orange?

- You added starch to EACH test tube. Which test tubes tested negative for the presence of starch after incubation? Why?

- Which test tubes still contained starch? Why?

- In the test tubes that were negative for starch, what product was formed?

- Which tube acted as a control?

- Why was it important to incubate the samples at 3737&deg;C?
