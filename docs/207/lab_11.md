# Lab 11: Reproduction

## Preparation for lab

To get the most out of this lab you need to be prepared. The basic knowledge needed for this lab is covered in "OpenStax Anatomy and Physiology" in Chapter 27.1 "Anatomy and Physiology of the Testicular Reproductive System" and Chapter 27.2" Anatomy and Physiology of the Ovarian Reproductive System".

## Introduction

The reproductive system is intricate and plays a pivotal role in the continuation of a species. It encompasses a range of organs and structures that work in unison to facilitate reproduction. Reproductive organs consists of external and internal structures - and differ between the male and female body: 

**Female Reproductive System**: The external part, known as the vulva, comprises the labia majora, labia minora, clitoris, and the opening to the vagina. The internal reproductive organs include the ovaries, which produce eggs (ova) and hormones like estrogen and progesterone. The fallopian tubes transport the ova from the ovaries to the uterus, a muscular organ where a fertilized egg can develop into a fetus. The uterus is connected to the outside of the body by the cervix, which opens into the vagina, a canal that serves as the site for sexual intercourse, the exit for menstrual blood, and the passageway for childbirth.

**Male Reproductive System:** The male reproductive system primarily consists of external and internal structures. Externally, the penis and scrotum are visible, with the penis containing erectile tissue and the urethra for the passage of urine and semen, and the scrotum housing the testes, crucial for temperature regulation in sperm production. Internally, the testes are essential for sperm production (spermatogenesis) and testosterone synthesis. Sperm mature in the epididymis and are transported through the vas deferens. The seminal vesicles, prostate gland, and bulbourethral glands contribute to the production of seminal fluid, a key component of semen, which nourishes and aids in the transport of sperm.

In this lab we will dissect the reproductive system of a boar to gain a better understanding of the structures.

## General Structure

Identify the following structure in your preparation:

- testes
- pelvic tract
- penis
- sigmoid flexure
- retractor penis muscle

The testes - male reproductive organs that produce sperm and hormones - are housed in the scrotum. Its wrinkled skin can relax in hot weather to allow the testes to move farther away from the body wall and thereby stay cooler. Sperm production is temperature sensitive and a few degrees above or below the ideal temperature can significantly affect sperm quality and quantity.

The visceral tunica vaginalis is attached to the testes. Cut into the visceral tunica vaginalis with a pair of scissors or scalpel blade.

A cross section through the testes reveals a series of lobules, each containing tightly coiled seminiferous tubules, the site of sperm production. These tubules are lined with germ cells in various stages of development and Sertoli cells that support spermatogenesis. Between the tubules lie interstitial cells (Leydig cells), responsible for producing testosterone. The testes are encapsulated by a dense, fibrous layer called the tunica albuginea, which extends inward to form septa, dividing the testes into lobules. This structure ensures an organized environment for efficient sperm production and hormonal regulation.

Now identify the **Spermatic Chord** as illustrated in the image below. The spermatic chord contains:

- arteries and veins
- lymphatics
- nerves
- muscle
- vas deferens

The vas deferens is a muscular tube that transports mature sperm from the epididymis to the ejaculatory ducts in preparation for ejaculation. You can also see the **external cremaster muscle**. which can contract or relax to move the testes closer or farther away from the body wall.

Examine the area where the parietal tunica vaginalis connects to the cauda epididymis. The connection between these two areas is the **gubernaculum** which prevents the testis from rotating and which is also  involved in testicular descent.

![boar_tract](.\figures\boar_tract.jpg)

In the pelvic portion of the boar reproductive tract identify the:

- vas deferens
- **bladder** (not shown above)
- **seminal vesicles** - paired accessory gland, very large in boar
- **prostate** - accessory gland, only body of prostate is present at this time
- **Cowper's glands** - paired accessory gland, very large in boar
- pelvic urethral muscle
- bulbospongiosus muscle
- retractor penis muscle which is paired and serves to pull the penis back into the male when the errection or ejaculation is finished.

(Note: boar do not have an ampulla)

![boar_prostate](.\figures\boar_prostate.jpg)

Now examine the prostate. First make a cut down the length of the prostate. Be sure to have the body of the prostate facing up as in the image. Its primary function is to produce a fluid that nourishes and transports sperm, forming part of the semen. You should now be able to see the tissue of the 2 portions of the prostate. 

- **body of the prostate gland** - a slightly yellowish to white tissue
- **disseminant portion of the prostate** - also yellowish to white in color but lying below or in the pelvic urethral muscle which is dark red

Now examine the penis. The end of the penis is covered by the:

- **prepuce** (foreskin in humans) If needed, pull back the prepuce, or even pull the penis out of the prepuce with a hemostat. 

- **glans penis**
- free end of the penis



![](.\figures\boar_penis_2.jpg)

Cut through the penis with a scalpel. Identify the:

- **tunica albuginea** - the thick connective tissue surrounding the penis
- **corpus cavernosum** - it consists of two sponge-like regions of erectile tissue which are found along the length of the penis. During sexual arousal, these tissues fill with blood, leading to an erection as they expand and harden, restricting the outflow of blood to maintain the erection. The veins are mostly located within the tunica albuginea and are not visible.
- **corpus spongiosum** - contains the urethra
- **penile urethra** - common pathway for semen or urine to exit the male



## Food for Thought

1. **Hormonal Regulation**: Name key hormones in the regulation of the menstrual cycle. How do these hormones interact to regulate ovulation and menstruation?
2. **Hormonal Functions:** Identify and describe the primary hormones produced by the testes. Discuss their roles in male physiology, including their effects on reproductive development, sexual characteristics, and overall health.
3. **Gametogenesis:** Briefly explain why mature gametes carry only one set of chromosomes.
4. **Contraception and Reproductive Health**: Discuss several methods of contraception, including their mechanisms of action and effectiveness. 
5. **Placental Function**: Describe the structure and function of the placenta. How does it facilitate the exchange of nutrients, gases, and wastes between the mother and fetus? Also, discuss the role of the placenta in hormone production.
