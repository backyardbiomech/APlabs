# Lab 6: Immune System (ELISA)

## Preparation for lab

To get the most out of this lab you need to be prepared. The basic knowledge needed for this lab is covered on [this website](https://www.immunology.org/public-information/bitesized-immunology/experimental-techniques/enzyme-linked-immunosorbent-assay).

## Introduction

ELISA - or Enzyme Linked Immunoabsorbant Assay - is a common laboratory technique that e.g. allows to test a large number of patient for a specific infectious disease, e.g. HIV, Lyme Disease, Bird Flue, or West Nile. ELISA uses the presence (or absence) of disease specific antibodies in the patient’s blood as an indicator for the patient infection status.

## Immune Response

An virus entering the blood stream of a patient triggers a specific immune response: Proteins on the outside of the virus act as *antigens* as they bind to *antibodies* in the blood that recognize the antigen’s specific shape. There are five different classes of antibodies (also called immunoglobulins or Igs) which all facilitate the destruction and/of removal of the antigen carrying intruder. The majority of antibodies (80%) are of the Y-shaped IgG type that has two "variable segment" antigen binding sites as well as a "constant segment" binding site that can activate the complement system or bind to macrophages, basophils, or mast cells of the immune system.

## How ELISA works

The ELISA techniques exploits the fact that a patient who has been exposed to a certain virus (or any antigen for that matter) will have an largely increased number of antibodies against this antigen. In other words the diagnosis is indirect - by showing an increase in specific antibodies in a patient’s blood we can conclude that the patient was (recently) infected with the disease and his immune system fought it.


Showing the presents of antibodies in a patient’s blood works in steps:

1. bind an antigen specific to the disease you want to diagnose to the bottom of a plate-well

2. pipette the patient’s blood serum into well - **if** the patient’s blood contains specific antibodies (AB) they will bind

3. wash non-bound serum away

4. pipette a secondary antibody specific agains the constant segment of human IgG into well - **if** there is human IgG bound, the secondary AB will bind

5. wash non-bound secondary AB away

6. the secondary AB is designed in such a way that the constant segment contains an enzyme

7. pipette chromogen into well - **if** enzyme is present it will react the chromogen causing a color change from green to purple
