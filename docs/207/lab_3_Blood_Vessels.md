# Fetal Pig Circulatory Dissection

## Readings:
1. Fetal pig dissection guide (notebooks in lab)
2. Chapters 18.6 and 18.7, including tables 18.4 (Major Systemic Arteries) and 18.5 (Major Systemic Veins))

## Objectives:
1. Identify the vessels and structures listed below, in a large pig heart, dissected pig, diagrams (pig or human), or by description
2. Diagram and describe their connections to other listed blood vessels and major organs or regions of the body
3. For every vessel, know if it usually carries oxygenated or deoxygenated blood.
3. Describe blood flow beginning from any heart chamber, to any major organ or body region (using just the vessels listed), and returning to that same heart chamber, including all heart valves.

## Food for thought:
1. Many times, the best way to identify a vessel is to look at the structures it attaches to on either end (most are named for the organ or region of the body they serve).
2. Practice drawing the flow of blood as a road map, with labels.
3. You may not be able to clearly identify all of the vessels in your pig. If you can't find them in your pig, ask your classmates if they can find it. You are **still** responsible for knowing where the vessel is, and what it connects to even if you can't find it!
4. Note one major difference between human and pig circulation near the heart: In the pig, two branches come off the aortic arch: the *brachiocephalic a.* and the *left subclavian a.*. The brachiocephalic give rise to **both** the *left* and *right common carotid a.'s*. In humans, the *left common carotid a.* arises directly from the aortic arch, so three arteries can be seen on the arch, beginning closest to the heart: the *brachiocephalic a.*, *left common carotid a.*, and *left subclavian a.*

## Example question:
You will be responsible for answering questions like the following, using the terms listed on this sheet: 

> Imagine you are a red blood cell sitting in the right atrium. Describe the path you would take (including all arteries, veins, location of capillary beds, heart chambers, and valves), that you would take from the right atrium to the stomach and back to the right atrium.

## Circulatory vessels to identify
Note: *a.* refers to the artery, *v.* refers to the vein. Some are paired, but in some the parallel arteries and veins have different names!
