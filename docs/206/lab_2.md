## PURPOSE

The purpose of this lab is for you to learn important bones and markings of the skeleton. But why is it important?

Begin able to identify bones and their anatomical landmarks has a wide variety of applications for those pursuing careers in health professions or those interested in organismal biology. For instance:

+ Knowing the bones helps scientists understand functioning of the musculoskeletal system and human movement. Muscles are the next thing we’ll learn about in lab!
+ Forensic scientists, anthropologists, and paleontologists use bones to help reconstruct how people or animals looked, lived, and died simply using bones. 
+ Help locate injection sites, palpate structures, and interpret imaging (like X-rays and MRIs).
+ Radiologists, and others, rely on bone landmarks to diagnose fractures, tumors, or degenerative disease. 
+ Surgeons use bone landmarks to guide incision or instrument placement
+ An understanding of what is “normal” can help diagnose something that is “abnormal”, such as the onset of arthritis or osteoporosis. 

Over the course of the next set of bone labs, you will be learning the bones of the body and all of their markings. This is hard work and will take lots of time! Please be patient with yourself. When you are feeling confident, pretend that you are a radiologist telling a doctor exactly where you are seeing a break on an X-ray. 

## TASK

1.	Listen to the pre-lab lecture and take notes.
2.	Study the list of bone terms below.
3.	Try to find each of the bones and their markings on the bones in the lab. 
4.	Review and study before you leave in preparation for the next quiz.
5.	Clean up your lab space

## CRITERIA FOR SUCCESS

You will have successfully completed the lab when you can identify every bone and marking that your lab partner quizzes you on. (you won’t get here today – practice in time for next lab!) 

## Lab 2: Bones and Markings of the Axial Skeleton

> **EVERYTHING on the list is fair game for the practical exam! 
Consider the entire list your study guide.**
<span style="color: red;">Note: **Bones may NOT be removed from lab**. </span> Any student removing bones from lab will be prosecuted!  Instead, please study the bones available in the "Bone Room" in the library.

Each category is divided into 3 groups:
+ **Essential terms** will make up about 70% of the practical. **Know these to earn a C-**
+ **Advanced terms** will be about 20% of the practical. **Know these to earn a C- to a B+**
+ **Mastery terms** will only be about 10% of the practical. **Know these to earn an A.**

1. Describe the human body using directional and regional terms
1. Define the two major divisions of the skeletal system (axial and appendicular) and list the general bone structures contained within each.
2. For the bones in the skull: identify, locate in the body, classify by shape and composition (compact vs. spongy), and relate shape to function.
3. For the bones in the skull: identify bone markings (spines, processes, foramina, etc.) and describe their function (e.g., point of articulation, muscle/tendon attachment, ligament attachment, passageway for nerves and vessels).
4. Locate the major suture lines of the skull and name the bones associated with each.
5. Define the paranasal sinuses and identify the location of each.
6. Name the bones that make up the walls of the orbit and identify the openings associated with the orbit.
