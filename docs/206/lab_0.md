<p style='text-align: center;'> <h2> Anatomy and Physiology Labs in General</h2> </p>

## PURPOSE

The main purpose of all of our Anatomy and Physiology (A&P) labs this semester is to apply what you’re learning in lecture, from your textbook, and other sources to real-life situations. It’s one thing to read about A&P and memorize facts and another to see how those facts work in real life. **These labs are the first of many hands-on experiences that you’ll have/need in the process of becoming a medical professional or researcher.** You should treat these lab experiences with the seriousness and intensity that you will bring to your clinical shadowing experiences in the coming years. 

Learning how to learn, effectively study, and work efficiently during these labs will set you up for success in other college classes and into your professional careers. 

## TASK

1.	Arrive on time and prepared for all A&P labs. Be sure that you have completed the pre-lab work and are prepared to take a quiz on last week’s material.
2.	Arrive ready to study. 
   a.	This includes basic things like being rested and having eaten. It’s hard to learn when you’re tired or hungry. If you having difficulties with either of these, please come talk to me during office hours. 
   b.	It also includes having the materials you need for lab, including proper clothing, a notebook and pen/pencil, and relevant handouts.
3.	Plan to stay the whole time. Longwood labs are only 110 minutes long, which is far shorter than the 180-minute labs at most universities. This means that students at other schools have more opportunities for hands-on interactions. To keep up, you’ll need to maximize the time you have here. 
4.	During lab, pay close attention to the pre-lab lecture and read instructions carefully.
5.	Take notes during the lab experiments.
6.	If you complete an exercise early, use that opportunity to study what you’ve just learned. A good idea is to take a 5-minute break and then come back to the exercise and try it again. 
7.	Once you have completed the lab, clean up your workspace and leave it in good condition for the next lab. 
8.	Following the lab period, study what you learned that day. 
   a.	Research shows that reviewing your notes for just 10 minutes the day that you learned something can help you learn as well as studying for hours the night before a test. 
   b.	Use your study time to prepare for the next quiz or lab practical. This can include making flashcards, creating your own figures, or quizzing a friend. 


## CRITERIA FOR SUCCESS

Your success in lab will be measured in two ways:

1.	Tests – lab tests can take the form of short quizzes on the previous lab, online quizzes, or lab practicals that are designed to test your knowledge of entire body systems. 
2.	Participation – you will be graded on the time you put into the lab. If you complete all of the items in “TASKS” above, you will earn 100% of the participation grade. You will lose points if you are not doing all of the TASKS for each lab period. 

# Laboratory Safety

1. General Safety Instructions:
   While working in the Science Laboratory you will have certain important responsibilities that do not apply to other classrooms. The materials and equipment that you will be working with if handled improperly can cause injury to yourself or others. Always follow the instructions of your professor or his or her designee. Your professor will give you further safety instructions on a laboratory by laboratory basis.

2. Prepare For Laboratory Work:
   - Study laboratory procedures prior to class.
   - Never perform unauthorized experiments.
   - Keep your lab bench organized and free of apparel, books, and other clutter.
   - Know how to use the safety shower and eyewash station.
   - Conduct yourself in a reasonable manner at all times in the laboratory. Horseplay, throwing items, and pranks are prohibited.

3. Avoid Hazards:
   - Keep combustibles away from open flames.
   - Use caution when handling hot glassware.
   - When diluting acid always add acid slowly to water. Never add water to acid.
   - Turn off burners when not in use.
   - Keep caps on reagent bottles. Never switch caps.

4. Clean Up:
   - Consult your professor for proper disposal of chemicals.
   - Wash hands thoroughly following the laboratory.
   - Leave laboratory bench neat and clean.

5. When Working With Chemicals:
   - Wear appropriate clothing in the laboratory; wear closed-toed shoes, no sandals or flip-flops, long pants, no shorts or skirts. Avoid loose or baggy clothing and dangling jewelry. If needed, confine or tie back long hair.
   - Wear safety glasses or goggles.
   - Wear gloves when using chemicals that irritate or can be absorbed through the skin.
   - Never taste or sniff chemicals.
   - Never pipette by mouth.

6. In Case Of Accident:
   - Report all accidents and spills immediately.
   - Place broken glass in designated containers.
   - Wash all chemicals from your skin immediately with plenty of water. If chemicals get in your eyes, wash them for at least 15 minutes with an eyewash.
